## About Me

Hey! I'm Alex, a software engineer living in the beautiful cities of Victoria and Vancouver, British Columbia. I graduated from the University of Victoria with a Bachelor of Software Engineering in 2024. I love creating innovative solutions and turning ideas into reality with code.

When I'm not coding, you might find me exploring the great outdoors, watching basketball games, or tinkering with the latest tech gadgets.
